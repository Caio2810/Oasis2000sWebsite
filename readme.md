# Oasis Fan Website

This project is a simple website designed to emulate the look and feel of early 2000s websites, focusing on the British rock band Oasis. The website includes really basic HTML and CSS, just made it while I was bored and tried to recriate a main page of a 2000s website type, remembering a nostalgic browsing experience.
